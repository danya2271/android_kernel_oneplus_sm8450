# The Make variable $(M) must point to the directory that contains the module
# source code (which includes this Makefile). It can either be an absolute or a
# relative path. If it is a relative path, then it must be relative to the
# kernel source directory (KERNEL_SRC). An absolute path can be obtained very
# easily through $(shell pwd). Generating a path relative to KERNEL_SRC is
# difficult and we accept some outside help by letting the caller override the
# variable $(M). Allowing a relative path for $(M) enables us to have the build
# system put output/object files (.o, .ko.) into a directory different from the
# module source directory.
